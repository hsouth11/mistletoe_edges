## FILE DIRECTORY

### /data 

-   Placeholder folder for data. To obtain the data download it here: xxxxxx. Then extract the zip folder inside of this data folder. The file structure and naming will align with what is shown below. 

#### /data/data_dictionary

data_dictionary.xlsx

- Excel workbook with dictionaries for each of the datasets used in analysis, except for the BC Government PSP dataset and the climate data from ClimateBC, which have their own dictionaries that are separate files. Only original variables are defined; variables derived in scripts are excluded.

psp_full_dictionary.xlsx

- Data dictionary for the BC Government Permanent Sample Plot (PSP) dataset (/data/cleaned/psp). See detailed description of the dataset itself under the dataset entry.

climate_bc_data_dictionary.pdf

- Data dictionary for the descriptive climate data for the research sites (/data/cleaned/hdm_sites_clim_data.csv). This file is a copy of the *Help* page from the ClimateBC webpage (https://climatebc.ca/Help2). See detailed description of the dataset itself under the dataset entry.

vri_full_data_dictionary.pdf

- This is an additional reference for the BC Government Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI) dataset (/data/cleaned/vri_c.csv). A dictionary for this dataset is included in the project dictionary (/data/dat_dictionary/data_dictionary.xlsx) because the original VRI dataset has been modified slightly. The original data set was (1) subset to a set of variables that are relevant for this project, (2) ID variables have been added linking VRI polygons to specific research sites and (3) some variables have been corrected to account for differences between the time a research site was measured and the year VRI data is projected to. This file is the original dictionary for the VRI dataset and provides additional details to what is in the project dictionary. 

#### /data/raw

Potential residual trees are large, moderate-severely infected hemlock that could have been present pre-harvest. Residual trees were cored to assess whether they were present pre-harvest (but these cores have not been analyzed). Residual trees have associated differential GPS points in /data/cleaned/hdm_trimbpoints.csv. These trees are removed from analysis to focus on the tree cohort that originated post-harvest. 

hdm_trimb_points.csv

- Processed differential GPS points taken at each edge spread field site. Points include: transect start and end points (in regen component), stem mapping plot centres (in mature component), residual trees, reference trees, the edge line separating regen and mature components and a rough line delinating the outer infection boundary in the regen component. Trees at each site are stem mapped relative to the transect/stem mapping points.

### /scripts

#### /scripts/cleaning and processing

-   Scripts for cleaning and processing raw data files (/data/raw).

tree_data_cleaning.Rmd

- Combines individual tree measurements from regenerating and mature components (/data/raw/regen_comp_data.csv and mature_comp_data.csv) and cleans them based on rules for each data field.

transect_data_cleaning.R

- Cleans up inconsistencies in transect data (data/raw/transect_data.csv) that arose from us working out the kinks in a field protocol.

extra_height_cleaning.R

- Cleans data for extra dominant/codominant hemlock trees measured to get estimates of average codominant/dominant hemlock height at each site (data/raw/regen_comp_extra_heights.csv).

vri_data_cleaning.Rmd

- Pulls out the relevant attributes from raw vri data (data/raw/vri_hdm_sites.csv), does some formatting, and where possible, corrects for differences between year a site was measured and the year it is projected in vri.

### /scripts

01_convert_dist_az_to_point.R

- Converts tree positions in raw data to georeferenced spatial features. In starting data, trees in the mature component are recorded as distance and azimuth from a stem mapping point. Trees in the regenerating component are recorded as x and y distance on a transect with a defined azimuth. Stem mapping points and transect start and end points had differential GPS points taken at them. The script maps tree locations from these GPS points using the distance and azimuth data. Input: ./data/cleaned/trees.csv. Output: ./data/workflow/trees_mapped.csv, which feeds into ./scripts/02_define_dmr.Rmd.

02_define_dmr.Rmd

- Defines tree-level dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR). Two versions of this variable are created: (1) traditional DMR: the sum of crown-third DMR ratings and (2) adapted DMR: a more general descriptor used to describe dwarf mistletoe infection in live and dead, susceptible trees. Input: ./data/workflow/trees_mapped.csv, from ./scripts/01_convert_dist_az_to_point.R. Output: ./data/workflow/trees_dmr.csv, which feeds into ./scripts/03_simulate_trees.Rmd.

03_simulate_trees.Rmd

- Simulates data to extend the regenerating component transects to a standard length of 50 m across sites. Regen transects were variable length to create felxibility in the measurement protocol and reduce field mneasurement time. Transect length was determined by the infected tree farthest from the edge or a minimum of 15 m. New trees are simulated based on measured data from a site and all simulated hemlock are healthy (because the transect length determined the outer infection limit). Input: ./data/workflow/trees_mapped.csv, from ./scripts/cleaning and processing/stem map.R. Output: ./data/workflow/trees_sim.csv, which feeds into ./scripts/04_crown_volume.Rmd.
 
04_crown_volume.Rmd

 - Gets simple crown volume estimates for each live hemlock crown class at each site. Heights are estimated by factoring measurements of dominant/codominant hemlock height by ratios with other crown classes, which were measured at one site (cr_3). Height to live crown is estimated based on a linear mixed effect model relating height to live crown to tree height, based on data from sites in the BC government permanent sample plot network that were similar to our field sites. Crown volume equations from Marshall et al. (2003) are used to generate final estimates. Input: ./data/workflow/trees_sim.csv and ./data/cleaned/psp. Output: ./data/workflow/trees_cv.csv, which feeds into ./scripts/05_seed_load.Rmd.

05_seed_load.Rmd

- This script estimates seed load—a proxy for the amount of HDM seed that is hitting a given target tree. There are three pieces in the script: (1) seed production is estimated by combining dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR) and crown volume estimates, (2) the proportion of a tree's seed production that reaches a given distance from the tree stem is estimated with a seed dispersal function and (3) pairs of source and target trees at each site are defined and interception between them is estimated. These three pieces are combined to estimate seed load. Data for the seed dispersal function are from Smith (1966), interception factors are based on Bloomberg et al. (1980) and numerous conceptual ideas take from Robinson et al. (2006). Inputs: ./data/workflow/trees_cv.csv and ./data/cleaned/pspseed_disp_smith1966.csv. Output: ./data/workflow/trees_sl.csv, which feeds into all the data analysis scripts.

06_exploratory_analysis.Rmd

- Exploratory data analysis comparing eleven edge spread research sites to eachother. Section 1 compares the different site climates using data from Climate BC (see https://climatebc.ca/mapVersion and see Wang et al. [2016]). A paper modelling HDM distributions at its northern limit (Barrett et al. 2012) is used as a framework for selecting and interpreting climate variables. There is a focus on precipitation because the Pacific Highway sites were the wettest and had relatively low rates of infection. Section 2 compares the size and composition of trees in the regen and mature components between sites. Section 3 compares HDM infection in the mature component between sites to get a  high-level understanding of whether the infection sources are similar between sites. Section 4 compares HDM infection in the regen component between sites. Summary tables and figures are created in each section for writing and downstream analyses. Inputs: ./data/workflow/trees_sl.csv, ./data/cleaned/hdm_sites_clim_data.csv and ./data/cleaned/vri_c.csv.

07_stem_maps.Rmd
- Generates stem maps, coloured by dwarf mistletoe rating, for each site. Inputs: ./data/workflow/trees_sl.csv and ./cleaned/hdm_trimb_points.csv. 

08_ordinal_regression.Rmd

- Fits ordinal models that predict the dwarf mislteotoe rating of live hemlock trees in the regenerating component from tree level variables (distance from the edge, DBH, crown class, seed load). Input: ./data/workflow/trees_sl.csv.

09_retention_geometry.R
- Generates geometries for "typical" clearcut and group retention cutblocks from a 16 ha area to provide an initial indication of how to zones of edge influence and associated HDM infection and timber impacts compare.

10_ep_footprints.Rmd
- Generates polygons capturing each research site to upload to the BC Government Experimental Project layer. Inputs: ./data/workflow/trees_sl.csv. Output: shapefiles in ./data/mof_footprints
